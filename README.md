# Program to calculate Devki Devi's current age based on Dhoni's current age

# Input: Age of Dhoni
dhoni_age = int(input())

# After 3 years, Dhoni's age
dhoni_age_after_3_years = dhoni_age + 3

# Let Devki Devi's current age be x
# After 3 years, Devki Devi's age would be x + 3
# According to the problem statement: x + 3 = 4 * (dhoni_age + 3)

# Rearranging the equation to find x
devki_devi_age = (4 * dhoni_age_after_3_years) - 3

# Output: Displaying Devki Devi's current age
print(devki_devi_age)
